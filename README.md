# Hi I'm John! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a machine learning scientist in the Prescient Design (Machine Learning for Drug Discovery) team at Genentech, where I work on developing ML and other computational methods for drug discovery. Before that, I was a postdoc in the Coley Research Group at MIT. I did my PhD in the Machine Learning Group (Dept. of Engineering) at the University of Cambridge and also was affiliated with the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems. On my GitHub you can find the code for my papers as well as my implementations for some general ML algorithms. Some highlights include:

## ðŸ“„ Code for Papers
[Synthesis DAGs](https://github.com/john-bradshaw/synthesis-dags) is code for our paper ["Barking up the right tree: an approach to search over molecule synthesis DAGs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11522).   
[Molecule Chef](https://github.com/john-bradshaw/molecule-chef) is code for our paper ["A Model to Search for Synthesizable Molecules"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05221).     
[Electro](https://github.com/john-bradshaw/electro) is code for our paper ["A Generative Model For Electron Paths"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1x4BnCqKX).   
[GPDNN](https://gist.github.com/john-bradshaw/e6784db56f8ae2cf13bb51eec51e9057) (and [here](https://gist.github.com/john-bradshaw/11bbf17dbca013d9fc3886a7bfe46840)) is a gist demonstrating some of the key concepts of our paper ["Adversarial Examples, Uncertainty, and Transfer Testing Robustness in Gaussian Process Hybrid Deep Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02476).


## ðŸ§º Misc
[ML for Molecules](https://github.com/john-bradshaw/ml-in-bioinformatics-summer-school-2020) is a notebook I wrote for a tutorial about ML for molecules.    
[`GNN`](https://github.com/john-bradshaw/GNN) is a library for graph neural networks in PyTorch.      
[`kriggie`](https://github.com/john-bradshaw/kriggie) is a playground for exploring Gaussian processes.    


(Note some of this work has been done in collaboration or been heavily inspired by work elsewhere, which I have tried to highlight on the repos' READMEs).
