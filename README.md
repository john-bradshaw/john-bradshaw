# Hi I'm John! 👋

I'm a PhD student in Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge/Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems. On my GitHub you can find the code for my papers as well as my implementations for some general ML algorithms. Some highlights include:

## 📄 Code for Papers
[Synthesis DAGs](https://github.com/john-bradshaw/synthesis-dags) is code for our paper ["Barking up the right tree: an approach to search over molecule synthesis DAGs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11522).   
[Molecule Chef](https://github.com/john-bradshaw/molecule-chef) is code for our paper ["A Model to Search for Synthesizable Molecules"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05221).     
[Electro](https://github.com/john-bradshaw/electro) is code for our paper ["A Generative Model For Electron Paths"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1x4BnCqKX).   
[GPDNN](https://gist.github.com/john-bradshaw/e6784db56f8ae2cf13bb51eec51e9057) (and [here](https://gist.github.com/john-bradshaw/11bbf17dbca013d9fc3886a7bfe46840)) is a gist demonstrating some of the key concepts of our paper ["Adversarial Examples, Uncertainty, and Transfer Testing Robustness in Gaussian Process Hybrid Deep Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02476).

## 🎓 Teaching
[ML for Molecules](https://github.com/john-bradshaw/ml-in-bioinformatics-summer-school-2020) is a notebook I wrote for a tutorial at the [Summer school for Machine Learning in Bioinformatics, Moscow, 2020](https://cs.hse.ru/ssml/).    


## 🧺 Misc
[`GNN`](https://github.com/john-bradshaw/GNN) is a library for graph neural networks in PyTorch.   


(Note some of this work has been done in collaboration or been heavily inspired by work elsewhere, which I have tried to highlight on the repos' READMEs).
